The BISI CST2101 Project - Diabetes Analysis consists of the solution of a notebook where different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima tribe are analyzed through the analysis of exploratory data.

Data Dictionary. The data set has the following information:

Pregnancies: Number of times you are pregnant. Glucose: 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test. Blood pressure: diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). Skin thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm). Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml). BMI: body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2). DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Function that scores the probability of diabetes based on family history. Age: Age in years. Result: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic).

To develop the notebook, the libraries are used: NumPy is geared towards efficient numerical operations. Pandas in data analysis and manipulation. Seaborn in statistical display (better appearance) Matplotlib.pyplot in creating graphs and visualizations.

The dimension of the data set is (1000, 9), the rows represent individual instances, the columns represent characteristics or variables of those instances.

Throughout the notebook, relevant information is obtained about the data set provided, variable analyzes are carried out through pairplot, kdeplot, scatterplot, etc. The three measures of central tendency are obtained.

Model is trained with Logistic Regression and random forest and it is indicated which one has the best performance according to the results.â€‹
